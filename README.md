# License-plate-detection-using-Deep-Learning

#The project is about car plate detection and character recognition using Deep Learning. Yolo v3
#architecture is used as it use COCO model dataset and easy to train on
Pytorch is used as framework for coding 
The detection system is tested mainly on cars in Malaysia.

The coding is executable and the simulated result is demonstrated as below
